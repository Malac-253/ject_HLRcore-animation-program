You don't know what goes on behind these eyes
You don't know the loneliness hidden inside
You don't know I wanna eat you up alive
Come and get to know me my type of wild
I'm the kind that spins you and hangs you dry
Well I'm already on to another side

If you gave me your whole life
I would still have room for more
'Cause I've got that appetite
Baby I never feel whole
You might get me through the night
But it will never be enough
It will nеver be enough
'Causе I'm a black-, I'm a black-, I'm a blackhole for your love

'Cause I'm a black-, I'm a black-, I'm a blackhole for your love
Your love, your love

'Cause it's true ooh nah nah nah, oh everything they say about me
I'll suck you ooh nah nah nah nah into my centre of gravity
'Cause it's true ooh nah nah nah oh everything they say about me
I'll love you like a supernova
Burn into you like a shooting star
